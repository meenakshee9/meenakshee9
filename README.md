**Introduction**

In our busy daily lives, it's essential to take care of our mental health. The Mental Fitness Tracker provides a user-friendly platform where individuals can track various aspects of their mental fitness and gain insights into their well-being. The application uses machine learning regression models to predict the user's mental fitness score based on a combination of numerical data and textual information provided by the user. The predicted score can offer valuable insights into one's mental well-being and serve as a guide to making positive changes in daily life.
